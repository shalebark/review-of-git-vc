How BVC Works:

    Objects:
        Same as git, but author data is not tracked, since its all one person.

    Branches:


    branches:
        List of all changesets for a branch is stored as a log file in .git/logs/refs/heads/{branch-name}
        The log file will have one row dedicated to each changeset in descending order.
        [Structure]:
            {parent-commit-hash} {commit-hash} {branch-author} {branch-creation-timestamp} {branch-creation-description}
            {parent-commit-hash} is 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 if it doesn't have a parent
            {branch-creation-timestamp} is a unix timestamp for the time of creation
            {branch-creation-description} some description that describes the branch creation like ("merge f6a89a79f229f12efd2eb5a92a60ab74d7dcef3d: Fast-forward" or "commit: hello")

        The HEAD of each branch is found in a file located in .git/refs/heads/{branch-name}. The file only contains the commit-hash.

    finding a specific revision regardless of branch:
        All changesets are found in a single file .git/logs/HEADS.
        This file have one line, in descending order, of every commit made.
        [Structure]:
            {parent-commit-hash} {commit-hash} {branch-author} {branch-creation-timestamp} {branch-creation-description}
        The structure is pretty much the same as the branches one, except in this file, it contains all branches
