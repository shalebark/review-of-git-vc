How BVC Works:

    3 types of objects (blob, tree, commit)
        All objects are stored inside .bvc/objects.

        Commit Object:
            [Structure]:
                tree {tree-hash}
                {commit-message}
            Basically, the Commit contains the hash to a tree object (this will lead to all the information needed to create a snapshot of the commit), and some additional details
            such as author and the commit-message.

        Tree Object:
            [Structure]:
                {file-permission} {file-type} {blob-hash} {file-name}
            The Tree Object contains all the files in a given commit.
            It has one line for each file, and each line contains a blob-hash which points to a snapshot of the file. The line also contains information such as file-permissions.

        Blob:
            [Structure]:
                {snapshot}
                This file contains only the snapshot of the file.
